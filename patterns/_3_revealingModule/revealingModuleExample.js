/*

The Revealing Module pattern came about because a particular developer
was frustrated with the fact that he had to repeat the name of the main 
object when we wanted to call one public method from another or access 
public variables.  

He also disliked the Module patternâ€™s requirement for having to switch
to object literal notation for the things he wished to make public.
